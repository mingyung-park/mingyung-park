## üöÄ Current Projects

**‚ùóHonors Thesis(ÎèÖÎ¶Ω Ïó∞Íµ¨) & NLP Study**

I am currently conducting independent research for my honors thesis class focused on the translation of natural language to first-order logic (FOL) using large language models (LLMs). 

This study explores how LLMs can enhance logical reasoning capabilities by effectively interpreting complex natural language queries and converting them into structured logical representations. I aim to investigate the implications of this translation for improving AI understanding and reasoning, as well as its potential applications in fields like law and formal logic.


**‚ùóComputer Vision Study**

Currently diving into the world of computer vision, exploring various aspects of image processing, analysis, and development.

<br/>

**‚ùóAlgorithm Challenge**

Constantly challenging myself with algorithm problem-solving and design. Participating in algorithm challenges on BaekJoon Online Judge platforms to enhance problem-solving skills and code optimization techniques.<br/>

<br/>

## üöÄ Recent Projects

**‚ùóMachine Learning Projects**

Participating in machine learning projects (JARVIS Repository).

Project focuses on detecting Website Fingerprinting attack on Tor network using both closed-word and open-word packet data.
<br/>

<br/>

**‚ùóServer & Backend (+ Frontend) Development**

I'm engaged in Capstone design projects that involve 
- server setup (AWS EC2, GCP VM)
- database management (AWS S3, RDS)
- AI model serving (Flask)
- API development (Django Rest Framework).
- participate in Frontend developement(React native)...
